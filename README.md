# Banking_project--mysql – SQL Project

This project is a simple Banking Management System built using MySQL, designed to understand how banking data is stored, linked, and managed using relational databases.

The system focuses on two core modules:

# 1. Account Management
 Stores customer account details such as:

 Account ID

 Customer Name

 Account Type

 Balance

 Contact details (if added)

# 2. Transaction Management
 Maintains a history of all customer transactions:

 Transaction ID

 Account ID

 Transaction Type (Deposit / Withdrawal / Transfer)

 Transaction Amount

 Date & Time

 Each transaction is linked to a specific customer account using a foreign key relationship.
